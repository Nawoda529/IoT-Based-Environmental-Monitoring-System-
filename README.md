# IoT-Based-Environmental-Monitoring-System-
This project implements an IoT-based Environmental Monitoring System that tracks real-time data on temperature, humidity, air quality, and noise levels using DHT22, MQ-135, and a noise sensor connected to ESP32 boards.

The system employs machine learning algorithms to analyze sensor data and predict environmental conditions. Results are displayed on a user-friendly web application, enabling users to monitor environmental stress levels and make informed decisions.

Features
  *Real-time monitoring of environmental factors.
  *Machine learning predictions of environmental states.
  *Data visualization via a web application.

Technologies Used
  *Hardware: DHT22, MQ-135, Noise Sensor, ESP32 (Master and Slave).
  *Software: Arduino IDE, Python (Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm), Firebase, Web           technologies.

Usage
  *This project is ideal for creating awareness about environmental conditions and    supporting proactive measures to mitigate environmental stress.
